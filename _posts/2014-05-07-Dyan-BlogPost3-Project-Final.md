* For this Blog Post # 3, I decided to addresses the to-dos listed in the Recap Blog published earlier for my above Project. This completes the project with my findings and conclusions given in this Blog #3: <br> 


#### Data Visualization Tool #2:

 Using this tool I was able to answer all five (5) questions What? When? Where? Who? Why? from the Over-Time Data presented without having to navigate through other charts in other Tabs unlike Tool #1. This was accomplished by having further breakdowns (sub divisions) of the X and Y Axis. Using selectable items in the drop downs and picking the data range I could avoid the clutter if I am interested in only a subset of the data. Tool Tips provided the answer in numeric values. Black box represents the budgeted OT data and the actual OT data is placed inside the black box and if it exceeds the budget it turns Red and extends above the Black Box. If the actual OT is less than the Budget then the inside box is Green and contained fully inside the Black box. Yellow means they are almost equal. This tool uses a .NET API and a more development effort was involved than the Tool #1 which was almost like a Plug and Play. Although the learning curve was much higher, using the API provided a lot more flexibility as you can see in the results. This tool has a potential to give answers to even a sixth question. (Now I have only one item selected for the Y axis and there is no minor category selected although I could have used one more additional level if I needed)
