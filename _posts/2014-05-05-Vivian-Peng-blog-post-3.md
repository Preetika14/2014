### Drawing 14,6000 Pills

## Background

The inspiration behind this blog post comes from one of my work assignments at Doctors Without Borders. With the currently available pills in the market, it takes up to 14,600 pills to treat one patient with drug-resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB). I was working on an advocacy campaign to push Big Pharma and scientific innovation to create better treatment for DR-TB. If you line up the pills, end-to-end, 14,600 pills is equivalent to the height of the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge. We wanted to showcase how insane that number is.

I designed this infographic that was meant to take along time to scroll down for the information you need.
