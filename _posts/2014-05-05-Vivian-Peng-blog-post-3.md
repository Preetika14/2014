### Drawing 14,6000 Pills

## Background

The inspiration behind this blog post comes from one of my work assignments at Doctors Without Borders. With the currently available pills in the market, it takes up to 14,600 pills to treat one patient with drug-resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB). I was working on an advocacy campaign to push Big Pharma and scientific innovation to create better treatment for DR-TB. If you line up the pills, end-to-end, 14,600 pills is equivalent to the height of the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge. We wanted to showcase how insane that number is.

I designed this infographic that was meant to take along time to scroll down for the information you need.

You can imagine how painstakingly long it took for me to draw out 14,600 pills in AdobeIllustrator. There has to be a better way!

## My plan for a better design

I was inspired by Josh Worth's ["If the moon were only 1 pixel"](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html) scrolling data visualization. I liked that the user had to continually scroll to the right to get the information, and the tracker at the bottom calculates the number of pixels scrolled and converts it into km distance from the sun.

I want to replicate a similar effect, where you can scroll to the right for information and the counter increases from 0 to 14,600. Instead of showing you the planets in Josh Worth's visualization, I would like to present the amount of water you would have consumed to intake that many pills.
