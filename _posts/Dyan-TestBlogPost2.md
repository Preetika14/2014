description: A color-coded map of the worldâ€™s most and least emotional countries - Revisited 
tags: blogpost
---

This Blog Post is a continuation of Blog Post 1 which was about a [Color-coded map of the world's most and least emotional countries](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/11/28/a-color-coded-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-emotional-countries/).

The problem with this map is, it has no interactive visualization capability. It has a great potential to be enriched by using interactive visualization techniques which is the goal of this Blog Post #2. Also I thought as a Data Science student it would be interesting to find out if there is any statistical correlation of this polled data to some other parameter such as the country's population etc.  


This is what I did for the Blog Post #2 in my attempt to make it interactive and have enhanced visualization that was missing in the Blog Post #1 and also provide grounds for further analysis in statistical sense.




The Maps I have are:
