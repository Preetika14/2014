This Blog Post is a continuation of Blog Post 1 which was about a [Color-coded map of the world's most and least emotional countries](https://github.com/ganepola/edav/blob/gh-pages/assets/dyan_assets/World's-emotional-countries.pdf).

This blog post is about a [Color-coded map of the world's most and least emotional countries](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/11/28/a-color-coded-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-emotional-countries/).

The problem with this map is, it has no interactive visualization capability. It has a great potential to be enriched by using interactive visualization techniques which is the goal of this Blog Post #2. 


This is what I did for the Blog Post #2 in my attempt to make it interactive and have enhanced visualization that was missing in the Blog Post #1.
